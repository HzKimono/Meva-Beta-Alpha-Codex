# Audit Archive

This folder contains historical audit, inventory, design, and mapping documents that are not required for day-to-day runtime or onboarding.

Active, operator-facing docs are kept in:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/GUARDED_LIVE_RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`
- `README.md`

Archive policy:
- Keep historical context here instead of top-level clutter.
- Do not treat archived documents as the source of truth for current commands/settings.
