# Operations Guide (Current)

For current production-safe operations, use these primary documents:

1. `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — primary runtime procedures.
2. `docs/GUARDED_LIVE_RUNBOOK.md` — staged rollout and live-trading guardrails.
3. `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` — security and threat assumptions.
4. `README.md` — install, quickstart, and command overview.

Historical or superseded operational audits were moved to `docs/AUDIT_ARCHIVE/`.
